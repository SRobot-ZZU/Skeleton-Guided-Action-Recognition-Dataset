# Skeleton-Guided-Action-Recognition-Dataset (EC-AR)
## Introduction
Since there are few action recognition datasets for elder-care robot, an Elder-Care Action Recognition dataset is built and is names as EC-AR. The EC-AR dataset contains 
four modes of video, and they are respectively RGB video, depth video, skeleton video and RGB-skeleton video. 

In EC-AR dataset, there are 14 types of caring actions for monitoring the elderly’s daily life, and they are classified into five categories: (1) daily actions: "stand", "lie", "sit", "bend"; (2) exercise actions: "walk", "squat", "push-up"; (3) risky actions: "fall", "lean"; (4) human-object interaction actions: "smoke", "answer the phone"; (5) human-robot interaction actions: "wave one hand", "hand up", "wave two hands". Eight volunteers (5 males and 3 females) participate in the filming in real home or laboratory environments, so as to diversify video data in EC-AR dataset. Each mode of video in the dataset consists of 6165 standard video clips. The length, frame rate and resolution of each video clip are respectively 96, 32fps, 1280×720. The training set, test set respectively has 17903 and 6757 video clips, and the ratio is 2.65:1. The sizes of RGB video, depth video, skeleton video and RGB-skeleton video are respectively 1.9GB, 905.1MB, 4.2GB, 10.4GB.
